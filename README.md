# Beta version release
OpenHybridsiM (OHM) is an open source tool for Electromagnetic Transient (EMT)-(Transient Stability)TS hybrid simulation, which is also the first publically available tool for hybrid simulation. It is developed based on another open source simulation software InterPSS (www.interpss.org) and the core engine of InterPSS is called to perform power flow and transient stability simulation. A general interface framework is provided to interface with different EMT simulator. An interface with PSCAD/EMTDC has been developed along with this tool. 

The tool is distributed as an executable Jar lib. To use the tool, please first download the jar from https://github.com/OpenHybridSim/OHM-release/blob/master/openHybridSimu_demo_V0.3.jar
